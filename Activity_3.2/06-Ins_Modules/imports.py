#The string.ascii_letters constant is a string that contains all the uppercase
#and lowercase letters of the English alphabet. This line of code prints those letters to the console.
print(string.ascii_letters)

#This line starts a for loop that will iterate 10 times. The loop variable x 
# takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., 9.
for x in range(10):
    print(random.randint(1,10))
    #Inside the for loop, this line generates a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
    #using the random.randint() function. It then prints that random number to the console.



#So, the code first prints all the letters of the English alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase), 
# and then it generates and prints 10 random integers between 1 and 10. 
# The output will vary each time you run the code due to the random nature of the random.randint() function.
